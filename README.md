# Welcome to My GitHub!
Hello! I’m an AI student at UQU, constantly exploring the endless possibilities of technology and programming. Whether it’s building web and mobile applications, diving into the world of game design, or exploring the wonders of computer vision and robotics, I’m always excited to push the boundaries of innovation.

While I’m deeply fascinated by reinforcement learning and robotics, I’m still on the journey to mastering these fields. I’m always eager to learn and expand my knowledge to create smarter, more intuitive systems.
## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

 • Programming Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, Shell
 
 • Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch (exploring), streamlit, pandas
